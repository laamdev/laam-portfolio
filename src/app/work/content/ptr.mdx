PTR is a leading UK provider of IT technical training and data consultancy services. This ongoing project involves migrating their legacy Drupal site to a modern Next.js platform while completely revamping the user experience and visual design. The new site is currently in development and will replace their existing site at ptr.co.uk in early 2024.

Key Features:

- Complete visual redesign with modern, responsive UI
- Interactive course catalog with advanced filtering
- Client portal for training materials and resources
- Contentful CMS for streamlined content management
- SEO optimization for improved visibility
- Real-time course availability updates
- Integrated booking and inquiry system

The new platform significantly improves content discovery and user engagement while maintaining PTR's established reputation in technical education and consultancy services. The migration from Drupal to Next.js will provide better performance, improved content management, and a more engaging user experience for both clients and staff.
