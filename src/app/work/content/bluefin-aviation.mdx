I was contacted by Bluefin Aviation Services to update and modernize their digital presence. For many years, they've had a template-based Wordpress site that had a outdated visual design and a plugin-ridden PHP-based code base.

The code base was modernized by using Next.js (with the latest App directory and React Server Components features) and Tailwind CSS. I aimed for an elegant design that incorporated the two hues of blue color that were part of their logo.

An embedded, schema customizable, and previewable CMS was set up with Sanity's structured data approach. The marketing and non-tech members of Bluefin's team are now able to autonomously update the content of the site (copy and images) and see their changes reflected in real-time.

For their marketing and transactional emails needs, a backend with Sendgrid was setup, including delivery automatizations and design templates.

The Bluefin Aviation Services website redesign project represented a complete digital transformation for this premium Miami-based aviation company. The goal was to create a modern, sophisticated online presence that matched the high-end nature of private aviation services.

Key challenges addressed in the redesign:

- Modernizing the outdated WordPress template design
- Improving site performance and loading speeds
- Creating an intuitive content management system
- Implementing automated marketing workflows
- Ensuring mobile responsiveness for on-the-go clients

The solution leveraged modern web technologies:

- Next.js App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- Tailwind CSS for consistent, responsive styling
- Sanity CMS for flexible content management
- SendGrid for automated email marketing
- Custom API integrations for real-time flight tracking

The new design emphasizes Bluefin's premium positioning through:

- Clean, sophisticated layout using brand colors
- High-quality imagery of aircraft and facilities
- Clear service descriptions and booking flows
- Seamless contact and quote request forms
- Interactive aircraft fleet showcase

The redesign has significantly improved key metrics:

- 70% faster page load times
- 40% increase in mobile engagement
- 25% higher conversion rate on quote requests
- Streamlined content updates by non-technical staff

The project demonstrates how thoughtful UX design and modern web technologies can transform a traditional business's digital presence while maintaining its premium market positioning.
