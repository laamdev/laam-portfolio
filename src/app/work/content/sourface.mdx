I was contacted by Bluefin Aviation Services to update and modernize their digital presence. For many years, they've had a template-based Wordpress site that had a outdated visual design and a plugin-ridden PHP-based code base.

The code base was modernized by using Next.js (with the latest App directory and React Server Components features) and Tailwind CSS. I aimed for an elegant design that incorporated the two hues of blue color that were part of their logo.

An embedded, schema customizable, and previewable CMS was set up with Sanity's structured data approach. The marketing and non-tech members of Bluefin's team are now able to autonomously update the content of the site (copy and images) and see their changes reflected in real-time.

For their marketing and transactional emails needs, a backend with Sendgrid was setup, including delivery automatizations and design templates.
