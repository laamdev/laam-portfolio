GP Rivals emerged from a passion for Formula 1 and a desire to create a more engaging way to analyze driver performance throughout the sport's history. The project aims to make F1 statistics more accessible and interactive for fans of all levels.

The application features a comprehensive database of F1 statistics from 1950 to the present day, allowing users to:

- Compare any two drivers head-to-head across their careers
- Analyze performance metrics like qualifying pace, race results, and championship points
- View interactive visualizations of driver performance trends
- Explore detailed race-by-race statistics and career highlights
- Track real-time updates during race weekends

Technical implementation focused on performance and user experience:

- Server-side rendering with Next.js for optimal performance
- Real-time data updates using web sockets
- Interactive charts built with D3.js for data visualization
- Responsive design that works seamlessly on all devices
- Efficient data caching strategies for quick access to historical data

The UI design emphasizes clarity and ease of use, with a color scheme inspired by F1's visual identity. Special attention was paid to making complex statistical data accessible and meaningful to casual fans while providing depth for hardcore enthusiasts.

Future plans include adding team comparisons, circuit statistics, and predictive modeling for race outcomes based on historical data.
