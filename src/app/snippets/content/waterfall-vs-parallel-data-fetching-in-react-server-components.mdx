With React Server Components, you can define and execute your data fetching function directly in the component itself:

```jsx
const fetchData = async (endpoint: string) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/${endpoint}`
  );
  return response.json();
};

const data = fetchData("cars");
```

When you need to make calls to different API endpoints inside the same component, you can use either execute your functions with either a waterfall (successive calls) or a parallel method (concurrent calls).

## Waterfall Fetching

- The execution of one of your fetching functions depends on the data returned by another function
- Use await in both calls

```jsx
const waterfall = async () => {
  const user = await fetchData("users/1")
  const userPorsts = await fetchData(`posts?userId=${user.id}`)
}
```

## Parallel Fetching

- The data fetching functions can be executed independently from one another
- Group both calls inside a Promise.all
- Don't await each call, instead await the execution of the Promise.all

```jsx
const parallel = async () => {
  const usersData = fetchData("users")
  const postsData = fetchData("posts")
  const [users, posts] = await Promise.all([usersData, postsData])
}
```
