I wanted to add a feature to my app. But that feature relied on a new version of a library I was using. But I coudn't just update this dependency, as it realied itself on a newer version of the React and Next dependencies.

I updated the library, and the feature worked. But then I realized that the new version of the library had a breaking change that affected another part of my app.

I had to spend a lot of time fixing that issue. I could have avoided this problem if I had been regularly updating my project dependencies.
