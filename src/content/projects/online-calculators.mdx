The client wanted to fully revamp the visual design and code of a PHP calculator website that was monetized with Google Ads. 

It was fundamental that the site was fast and performant in order to achieve a Lighthouse score as close to 100 as possible. A SEO optimization strategy was also fundamental to achieve high positions in Google searches and increase the site's organic traffic.

The site's routing structure was outlined loosely based on the original PHP codebase, but most of the original code was scratched except some core calculators' functions. Permanent redirects were setup to prevent dead backlinks from third-party sites that would negatively affect our SEO positioning.
