title: The zero issue in jsx with the logical AND

## Issue

### Logical AND of possibly zero value (renders 0)

```jsx
"use client"

import { useState } from "react"

export default function ProductsInStock() {
  const [productsInStock, setProductsInStock] = useState([])

  return <div>{productsInStock.length && "Products in stock"}</div>
}
```

## Fixes

### Conditional (force boolean with double negation)

```jsx
<div>{!!productsInStock.length && "Products in stock"}</div>
```

### Conditional (specify length)

```jsx
<div>{productsInStock.length > 0 && "Products in stock"}</div>
```

### Ternary operator (use null)

```jsx
<div>{productsInStock.length ? "Products in stock" : null}</div>
```
