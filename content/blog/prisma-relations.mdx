You have to define two Author related properties in the Book model:

1. authorId, which is of type String
2. author, which is of type Author and references the Author model

```prisma

model Book {
  id        String   @id @default(cuid())
  title     String   @db.VarChar(255)
  authorId  String
  author    Author   @relation(fields: [authorId], references: [id])
}

model Author {
  id     String   @id @default(cuid())
  name   String   @db.VarChar(255)
}
```
